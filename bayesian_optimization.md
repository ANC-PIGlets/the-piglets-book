__Overview__

Bayesian optimization (BO) is a modern approach to global optimization of blackbox-style functions. For the most part, BO techniques assume that the target function is expensive to evaluate and, therefore, seek to minimize the number of queries made during the process of optimization.

Here, our goal will be to provide a high-level survey of key concepts in Bayesian optimization, specifically as pertains to notions of automated Machine learning (autoML).
